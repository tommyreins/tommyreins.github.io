```
Cover me up and spread me down
No other words can reach this town
Three twisted shadows do remain
With legions carved on to my brain
Fill them in with glue and pink gum
So this dull boy feels less hum drum 
As his truck rolls the back highway
Don’t give him the keys they should say
But drunk don’t listen to today
Lock him up and his hands of clay
Yeah, tomorrow will have to pay 
```
