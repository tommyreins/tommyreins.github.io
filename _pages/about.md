### bio

Raised in Littlton, CO -- halfway between the city of Denver and the massive Rocky Mountains. Grew up hiking, biking, backpacking, and playing tennis. Was fortunate enough to attend a Jesuit high school, where I devoured many extra-curriculars instead of my homework.

Studied Computer Engineering at Iowa State University in Ames, IA. Got clean in 2016, age 21. Shortly after, got my first A in *CS 311 Algorithms* and tutored it for 3 semesters. Started a research project that built robotic drone refueling stations, and then attempted to turn it into a company. After that adventure + several internships, I graduated in 2018 with a big job offer.

Summer after graduation, I moved to Seattle, WA to work at Microsoft. Spent four years working as a Program Manager across many epic teams and products including O365, Exchange: Build + Infra, Substrate, RS5, WS2019, WS2022, and Azure Container Platform + Runtime. I was lucky to find some great mentors, great friends, and survive a pandemic. Being in WA, I also got to rekindle my love of the outdoors. I bought a truck that took me to a ton of hikes, backpacking trips, off-grid campouts, and roadtrips.

The urge to chase my dreams and go start another venture hit me after four years at Microsoft. In 2022, I quit and moved back to the Midwest to do it. Over the summer I did RAGBRAI 49. Last fall I completed my first half marathon in Des Moines.

In 2023, I'm excited to launch our first product from the venture and serve manufacturers in the Midwest! More to be revealed soon.
