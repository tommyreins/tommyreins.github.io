### bio

Raised in Littleton, CO -- halfway between the city of Denver and the massive Rocky Mountains. Went to college at Iowa State University, worked for 4 years in Seattle at Microsoft, and now I'm back in Iowa building my own company. My hobbies include running, cycling, reading, board games, and video games.
