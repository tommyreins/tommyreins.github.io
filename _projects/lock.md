I never asked about her locks
and she loved that it meant I wasn't one of the flocks
to me she was beautiful and a prize I won
scrolling and swiping I was a son of a gun

now she's got a lock on her digit
left hand taken don't you get it
I knew I wasn't the one
just some son of a gun

two years later in the back of my mind
fond memories remain of what's now behind
my neck still turns when a gal has the color
crimson, cardinal, or rose, or another

now she's got a lock on her digit
left hand taken don't you get it
I knew I wasn't the one
just some son of a gun

I wonder if I could have found
magical words or dancing or sound
that would have served us like a bobby pin
with hair down we'd pick our way in

now she's got a lock on her digit
left hand taken don't you get it
I knew I wasn't the one
just some son of a gun
