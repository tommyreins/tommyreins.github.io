### bio

`Raised in Littlton, CO` -- halfway between the city of Denver and the massive Rocky Mountains. `Grew up hiking, biking, backpacking, and playing tennis.` Was fortunate enough to attend a `Jesuit high school`, where I devoured many extra-curriculars instead of my homework.

Studied `Computer Engineering at Iowa State University` in Ames, IA. Got clean in 2016, age 21. Shortly after, `my first A was in CS 311 Algorithms` and I tutored it for 3 semesters. Started a research project that built `robotic drone refueling stations`, and then attempted to turn it into a company. After that adventure + several internships, I `graduated in 2018` with a big job offer.

Summer after graduation, I moved to Seattle, WA to work at `Microsoft`. Spent four years working as a Program Manager across many epic teams and products including `Exchange: Build + Infra`, `Substrate`, `Azure Kubernetes`, and `Azure Container Platform`. I was lucky to find some great mentors, great friends, and survive a pandemic. Made memories hiking, backpacking, and off-grid camping.

The urge to `chase my dream` of starting another venture hit me hard. After four years at Microsoft - I quit and moved back to the Midwest to do it. Over the summer, I bicycled across Iowa for `RAGBRAI 49`, and this fall, I ran my first `half marathon` in Des Moines.

In 2023, I'm excited to `launch our first product` from the venture and serve manufacturers in the Midwest! `More to be revealed soon.`
