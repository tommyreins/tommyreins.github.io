```
Another day
to sink my teeth
into the way
of way beneath.

I pray for you
and you for me
that we may do
the will of He.

Forever watch
Children play with
fire, not of scotch
in shot or fifth.

No, this fire be
Only cool when
Water from sea
Pours down on them.

Help me ask You
To water me;
I wish for true
Serenity.
```
