### bio

Raised in Littleton, CO -- halfway between the city of Denver and the massive Rocky Mountains. Grew up hiking, biking, backpacking, and playing tennis. Was fortunate enough to attend a Jesuit high school, where I devoured many extra-curriculars instead of my homework.

Studied Computer Engineering at Iowa State University in Ames, IA. Got clean in 2016, age 21. Shortly after, got my first A was in CS 311 Algorithms and I tutored it for 3 semesters. Started a research project that built robotic drone refueling stations, and then attempted to turn it into a company. After that adventure + several internships, I graduated in 2018 with a big job offer.

Summer after graduation, I moved to Seattle, WA to work at Microsoft. Spent four years working as a Program Manager across many teams and products including Exchange: Build + Infra, Substrate, Azure Kubernetes, and Azure Container Platform. I was lucky to find some great mentors, great friends, and survive a pandemic. Made memories hiking, backpacking, and off-grid camping.

In 2022, the timing was perfect to chase dreams of starting another venture. So, after four years at Microsoft, I quit and moved back to the Midwest to do it. While building an MVP, I kept myself active. Over the summer, I bicycled across Iowa for RAGBRAI 49, and in the fall, I ran my first half marathon in Des Moines.
