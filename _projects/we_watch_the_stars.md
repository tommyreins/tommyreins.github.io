One by one, we watch the stars
Pass us by just like the hours.
To the two who war each night,
My brother, you think we might
Join the eternal struggle?
We need to learn to juggle.
Can’t tell one from another.
Hands cover ears and smother.
Will days come when it makes sense?
My world is my mind defense.
Praying only was for me -
Mercy me! Bent symphony 
‘Round verses that disappear,
Like the snake that turned to spear.
So I gripped that cold bloody,
Up it went from earth muddy.
My throw was off the target
I thought before the mark hit.
Shooting ‘cross the sky it flew,
So below a child could rue
The stars won. Bye! Hello, one;
Tears pouring at rising sun.
