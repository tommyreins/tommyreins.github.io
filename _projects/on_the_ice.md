```
Foggy eyes and two ear plugs
Cotton mouth and leather gloves
Can’t smell either - too much wind
Howling through my open grin
All there’s left to do is laugh
You don’t even know the half
Days spent wandering so lost
Toes all bitten from the frost
But I don’t need them today
Not just the toes - hear me say
“My body is broken down
Soon to end up underground
So take it Lord, with my will
Unshackle me to fulfill 
This mission unprotected”
All along I neglected
My rotten will made me numb,
So sour, deaf, blind, and dumb
I want to feel this life raw;
Death may not end in a draw.
Tomorrow is unwritten.
Now I kneel and I listen.
