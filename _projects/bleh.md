```text
As it turned to black, I let it fall down
onto my sheets. I sighed without a sound.
It needed to sleep and come back full charge.
Into my trameled focus it will barge;
but, I had sent invitation for it
to trespass against my peace of mind and wit.
So slowly, moments turn to still hours
as the scrolling screen, rolling, gains powers
to trick and hypnotize my mind away -
not living life or loving day to day.
```
